# gmappr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A shiny app to plot maps with data. Currently plots only North Macedonia but can be easily extended. The app can be found online here: https://novica.shinyapps.io/nmkmappr/.

This is a version using [{golem}](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) -- that's what the 'g' stands for. Otherwise it is the same app as https://github.com/discindo/mappr. 


## Some notes

* The map data are from https://wambachers-osm.website/boundaries/

* The demo data are from http://www.stat.gov.mk/


## Installation

You can install the released version of gmappr from [github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("discindo/gmappr")
```
